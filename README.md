# OLED-lil-guy
display a set of eyes on an OLED (.96" display was used) and change the response based off touch sensor input, just like patting it on the head!

wiring is simple! use a small breadboard for a shared VCC and GND <br/>
GND -> ground power rail <br/>
5V -> positive power rail <br/>

connect GND and VCC to the power rails :) <br/>
SIG on the touch sensor is connected to A0 <br/>

DISPLAY: <br/>
SDA = A4 <br/>
SDK/SDL (depending on your model) = A5 <br/>
^ can change based off what board you're using <br/>
